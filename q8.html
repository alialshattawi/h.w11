q7
Write a JavaScript and Ruby program that will take three arrays, and will create three newarrays (two, three, five). The first array (two) will have all the elements divisible by 2 from thethree input arrays.
The second array (three) will have all the elements divisible by 
3 from theinput arrays. The last array (five) will have all the elements divisible by 5 from those input arrays

	

var a=[1,2,3,4,5];
var b=[11,12,13,14,15];
var c=[21,22,23,24,25];
var mer=[]; 
var two=[];		
var three=[];	
var five=[];


mer=a.concat(b,c); 

for (i=0;i<mer.length;i++){

	if(mer[i]%2===0){
		two[i]=mer[i];
	}

	if(mer[i]%3===0){
		three[i]=mer[i];
	}

	if(mer[i]%5===0){
		five[i]=mer[i];
	}
}

console.log("# divisible by 2 ="+two);
console.log("# divisible by 3 ="+three);
console.log("# divisible by 5 ="+five) ;
